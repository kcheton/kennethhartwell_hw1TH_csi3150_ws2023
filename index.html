            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Greetings! I'm Kenny Hartwell. I'm a dedicated senior IT student at Oakland University and I'm very passionate about system administration, and Cybersecurity!!!
                I am 20 yrs old, and I live with my family in southeast Michigan.
                I enjoy reading, listening to electronic music, and playing guitar! I am an avid history enthusiast and I also love playing video games. 
                Though I study IT, I have much experience in programming, having taken advanced university courses in areas such as Object Oriented Programming, Unix commandshell, and knowledge on how to use Linux.
                Although I CAN program, it is not my specialty, as I much prefer general IT diagnostics work, and desire to work in a field such as cybersecurity, as it is important to me that everyone has a rigth to privacy.
            </p>
